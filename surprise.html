        Kidding aside, I hope you'll enjoy your day. Much as there are bad things in life, there are also
         many things that I think are worth living for (like me). And although we may not be able to 
         foresee the future, I hope you can find things that will make you smile. To quote Blaise Pascal, 
         "In difficult times, carry something beautiful in your heart." Thank you for everything. I 
         really appreciate all the things you do. I mean that. Sorry I can be hard to understand sometimes. 
         I hope you'll become successful in the future. Always take care of yourself. Enjoy the rest of 
         your day!
